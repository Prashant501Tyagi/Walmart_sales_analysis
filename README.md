# Walmart Sales Analysis Project

## Overview:

The Walmart Sales Analysis Project aims to analyze sales data from Walmart stores to derive actionable insights and make data-driven decisions. The project involves gathering, cleaning, and analyzing sales data to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and factors affecting sales performance.

## Business Problem:

Walmart, as a retail giant, faces various challenges and opportunities in managing its sales operations effectively. Some of the key business problems addressed by this project include:

- Understanding sales patterns: Analyzing sales data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in sales to optimize inventory management and pricing strategies.
- Customer segmentation: Identifying different customer segments based on purchasing behavior to tailor marketing and promotional strategies to specific customer groups.
- Product performance analysis: Evaluating the performance of different products and categories to determine which products are driving sales and which ones need improvement.
- Store performance assessment: Assessing the performance of individual stores to identify underperforming stores and take corrective actions to improve sales.
